	<p><h1> Fairytale Gone Bad </h1></p>
 	

		
	<div>  This is the end you know </div> 
	<div>  Lady, the plans we had went all wrong </div>
	<div>  We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears. </div>
	</br>
	<div>  We got to a point I can't stand</div>
	<div>  I've had it to the limit, I can't be your man </div> 
	<div>  I ain't more than a minute away from walking</div>
	</br>

	<div>  We can't cry the pain away </div>
	<div>  We can't find a need to stay </div>
	<div>  I slowly realized there's nothing on our side </div>
</br>


	<span> Out of my life, Out of my mind </span>
</br>
	<span> Out of the tears we can't deny </span>

</br>
	<span> We need to swallow all our pride </span>

	</br>
	<span> And leave this mess behind </span>
	</br>
	<span> Out of my head, Out of my bed </span>
	</br>
	<span> Out of the dreams we had, they're bad </span>
	</br>
	<span> Tell them it's me who made you sad </span>
	</br>
	<span> Tell them the fairytale gone bad </span>

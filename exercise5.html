	<p> You may already know that July 2018 will see a DC Entertainment and Warner Bros Aquaman film splash onto our screens (and before that, Jason Momoa will have realised the character in Zack Snyder's Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice in 2016, and the first Justice League movie the year after). All the evidence we’ve seen suggests that this will be as dark and gritty a screen rendering as The Dark Knight or Man Of Steel, which those who are familiar with the character might see as slightly unbelievable.</p>

 <span> <strong>Indeed, outside the core fan-base of comic book readers, the character Aquaman doesn’t always have the best reputation. Kids' animated television series Batman: The Brave And The Bold is one such example, which pins Aquaman as the all-singing, all-silly comic relief to the better known, more respected superheroes.

If you’re wondering why you should care that Aquaman is getting a movie, then, we compiled all the information on the chap to fill you in.  </strong> </span>
